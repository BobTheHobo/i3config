# General
My configuration for adding [i3](https://i3wm.org/) for window management on top of [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) XFCE

Used Feeble Nerd's setup instructions [here](https://feeblenerd.blogspot.com/2015/11/pretty-i3-with-xfce.html).

## Notes
- This configuration assumes and uses i3 for all keyboard shortcuts related to the desktop. Therefore you have to remove your desktop's existing keyboard shortcuts to use it, which Feeble Nerd's guide walks you through.
- In case you want to revert your keybinds, xfce-settings has a "Reset to Defaults" button that you can use to restore all default keybinds.
